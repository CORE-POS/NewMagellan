# NewMagellan
This repo is just a storage area for pre-built binaries of the NewMagellan driver. The code will continue to live in https://github.com/CORE-POS/IS4C.

The directory containing NewMallean's code is https://github.com/CORE-POS/IS4C/tree/master/pos/is4c-nf/scale-drivers/drivers/NewMagellan.

You can absolutely still build your own driver. Just run "msbuild" or "xbuild" in the project directory. The point of these builds is to provide consistency in deployments.

Current builds are 32-bit, .NET 4.0.
